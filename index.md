The Community for Rigor (C4R) is part of a new NIH initiative to improve rigor in science. It consists of METERs, groups that develop awesome materials that teach principles of rigors across the United States. It also consists of CENTER, a group at the University of Pennsylvania that aims to make materials really wonderful and to scale their use. The goal of community for rigor (C4R) is to bring more rigor to science by better teaching.

## The METER projects
The goal of the METER projects is to produce units that, in a self-contained way, teach aspects of rigorous science. Each UNIT will be able to be consumed by itself and will be independent of other UNITS. The goal is that, after optimization through CENTER, the materials should be useful when consumed by themselves, the materials should be easy to embed into existing courses, and they should be useful for everyone consuming them.

## The CENTER project

The goal of the CENTER project is to create an educational nexus for training in experimental rigor. We build, evaluate, and disseminate a user-friendly, harmonized, and openly accessible educational resource to promote awareness, understanding, and utilization of the principles of rigorous biomedical research. We will produce wonderful animations and videos. The current plan is to build a tech-stack based on jupyter books and jupyter notebooks. This project is [supported by the NINDS](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-NS-21-009.html). The main goal for CENTER is to help facilitate a worldwide community driving for meaningful improvements in scientific rigor. In the end, we will also want to see quantitative reflections of this change.

## History and leadership

C4R was inaugurated in August of 2022. It is currently reaching out to the community to find out how it can be most impactful. Stay tuned for developments and materials. And get in touch [koerding@gmail.com](mailto:koerding@gmail.com). We are committed to a broadly inclusive effort, all scientists who want to work towards a more rigorous scientific field should feel welcome into the community for rigor. 


## Job openings

We will be opening multiple roles in education, content creation, front-end and back-end development, as well as administrative support roles. Stay tuned for announcements.

## Inspiration
We're inspired by various groups in the scalable teaching communities. A good number of CENTER/METER participants were involved in the  grassroots success in creating [Neuromatch Academy](https://neuromatch.io). We are inspired by [Software carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/). We are inspired by the many other groups producing open source code. We are also inspired by other open source groups including [OSF](https://osf.io/). And we are thankful for all the Champions of Academic Rigor who are too numerous to name and who have blazed a path towards a brigher future in science.
