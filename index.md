The Community for Rigor (C4R) at the University of Pennsylvania dedicated to bringing reproducibility to science.

## The CENTER project

The goal of the CENTER project is to create an educational nexus for training in experimental rigor. We build, evaluate, and disseminate a user-friendly, harmonized, and openly accessible educational resource to promote awareness, understanding, and utilization of the principles of rigorous biomedical research. We're inspired in part by by our grassroots success in creating [Neuromatch Academy](https://neuromatch.io). This project is [supported by the NINDS](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-NS-21-009.html).

## History and leadership

The Center for Leadership is lead by [Konrad Kording](http://kordinglab.com). C4R was inaugurated in August of 2022. It is inspired by our success in launching a large-scale online summer school dedicated to teaching rigorous methods in computational neuroscience and AI, [Neuromatch Academy](https://neuromatch.io).

## Job openings

We will be opening multiple roles in content creation, front-end and back-end development, as well as administrative support roles. Stay tuned for the announcement shortly.
